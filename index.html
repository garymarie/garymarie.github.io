				<p >I am a Senior Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Maynooth University working primarily on the VALU3S project. 
					As part of this project, I am researching verification tools and techniques with a focus on verifying an aircraft engine conrtoller.  
					I was previously at the Universities of Manchester and Liverpool where I was working on the EPSRC 
					funded FAIR-SPACE Hub but also participating in the RAIN and ORCA Hubs. This work focused on using and combining 
					formal methods to reason about and provide certification evidence for robotic systems that are to be deployed in hazardous environments.
					I received my PhD from Maynooth University in 2017 for my work on defining a semantics, modularisation constructs and interoperability
					for the Event-B formal specification language using the theory of institutions.
